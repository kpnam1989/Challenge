This folder contains my work based on data from Lending Club, which was provided by Nathan George on Kaggle ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club)). This is a rich dataset that contains much financial information about individual loans originated from Lending Club from 2007 until 2017. 

This folder contains 3 files:
- Exploration: explore basic features of the data
- Basic Modeling: further exploration, and I constructed a basic model to have some ideas of how the data will behave
- Further Improvement: more feature engineering, comparnig the performance between GBM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
